            The input samples.
            If `'no_validation'`, no validation is performed on `X`. This is
            useful for meta-estimator which can delegate input validation to
            their underlying estimator(s). In that case `y` must be passed and

            `y_numeric`.
        y : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default='no_validation'
            The targets.
            - If `None`, `check_array` is called on `X`. If the estimator's
              requires_y tag is True, then an error will be raised.
            - If `'no_validation'`, `check_array` is called on `X` and the
              estimator's requires_y tag is ignored. This is a default
              placeholder and is never meant to be explicitly set. In that case
              `X` must be passed.
            - Otherwise, only `y` with `_check_y` or both `X` and `y` are
              checked with either `check_array` or `check_X_y` depending on
              `validate_separately`.
        reset : bool, default=True
            Whether to reset the `n_features_in_` attribute.

               should set `reset=False`.
        validate_separately : False or tuple of dicts, default=False
            Only used if y is not None.
            If False, call validate_X_y(). Else, it must be a tuple of kwargs
            to be used for calling check_array() on X and y respectively.
